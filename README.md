# JavaAIScript

JavaAIScript is a JavaScript module for analyzing JavaScript code and suggesting fixes to align it with Java concepts using ChatGPT.

## Installation

To use JavaAIScript, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install java-ai-script
```

## Usage

```javascript
// Import the JavaAIScript module
import JavaAIScript from 'java-ai-script';

// Initialize the module with your ChatGPT API key
const javaAIScript = new JavaAIScript('YOUR_CHATGPT_API_KEY');

// Analyze JavaScript code and identify deviations
const code = `function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}`;
const deviations = await javaAIScript.analyzeJavaScriptCode(code, {
    context: 'Project context information'
});

// Suggest fixes for identified deviations
const fixes = await javaAIScript.suggestFixes(deviations);

// Collect feedback from developers
await javaAIScript.collectFeedback(fixes, 'Feedback from developers');

// Present analysis results and fix suggestions
javaAIScript.presentResultsAndSuggestions(deviations, fixes);
```
